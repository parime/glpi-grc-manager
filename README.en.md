## The problem

GLPI knows exactly which hardware, software and systems make up your organization. What it can't
natively do is answer the questions a security officer or an ISO 27001 auditor actually asks:

> **What are my organization's risks, not just the technical ones, who accepted them and why, and
> am I compliant with Annex A?**

**GLPI GRC Manager** covers generic organizational risk (ISO 27001 clause 6.1.2/8.2): people,
process, physical, third-party, with acceptance, treatment, a Statement of Applicability (SoA),
internal audits and corrective actions — and, since v2.0, a real "Security Incident" ITIL object
(absorbed from the sibling plugin glpi-security-incidents, now archived), with its ISO 27001
classification fields merged directly onto it.

## What the plugin brings (see ROADMAP.md)

- **Generic risk register**: category (people/process/physical/third-party/technical),
  probability, impact, computed risk level, treatment decision (accept/mitigate/transfer/avoid),
  owner, justification, review date.
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**: the 93 ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls (clause 6.1.3).
- **ISMS requirements (clauses 4 to 10)**: the 30 sub-clauses 4.1 to 10.2, with status, owner,
  evidence (linked GLPI documents), a link to the module that already covers them and a
  completeness rate, included in the PDF export.
- **Internal audit program**: non-conformities, corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).
- **Supplier/third-party risk register.**
- **Security awareness training tracking.**
- **Management reviews.**
- **Security incidents**: a full ITIL object in the Assistance menu (actors, workflow, tasks,
  notifications, CVE tracking), with ISO 27001 classification (category, severity, root cause/
  lessons learned required at closure) merged onto it (Annex A A.5.24-27). Each part of the module
  can be enabled/disabled independently (Configuration > Plugins).

## Project status

**Stable v2.2.0**, published and installable right now: generic risk register (administrable
probability x impact matrix, interactive heatmap, filters, review reminders), Statement of
Applicability (93 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A controls), internal audit program with
non-conformities and CAPA, supplier/third-party risk register, security awareness training
tracking (including assessment pass rate) and management reviews, a full Security Incidents module
(ITIL object, CVE tracking, absorbed from the sibling plugin `glpi-security-incidents` in v2.0.0),
and a complete ISMS dashboard. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned next and
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history of published versions.

## Installation

**1. Get the code** into your GLPI's `plugins/` directory, under the name **`grcmanager`** (GLPI
derives the plugin key from it):

- From a [release](https://github.com/parime/glpi-iso27001-management/releases) (recommended, no
  dependency to install — `vendor/` is already bundled in the ZIP): download
  `glpi-iso27001-management-X.Y.Z.zip`, extract it into `plugins/`, then rename the extracted
  folder to `grcmanager`.
- Or for development, from source:

```bash
cd /var/www/glpi/plugins
git clone https://github.com/parime/glpi-iso27001-management.git grcmanager
cd grcmanager
composer install --no-dev
```

**2. Install and enable it**, from the UI (**Setup > Plugins**, "GLPI GRC Manager") or from the
command line:

```bash
php bin/console plugin:install grcmanager
php bin/console plugin:activate grcmanager
```

## Documentation

📖 **[See the full tutorial](docs/TUTORIAL.md)**: the plugin's whole flow, from activation to the
dashboard, through the risk register, the probability x impact matrix, the SoA and audits/CAPA,
with a real screenshot for every step (available in French and English).

## Disclaimer: ISO 27001 and third-party frameworks

**This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by or certified by ISO (International
Organization for Standardization), IEC or AFNOR.** The "ISO 27001" wording in the repository name
and documentation only identifies the framework the plugin helps you track.

- **What the plugin contains**: only the **references** of the 93 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A
  controls (A.5.1 to A.8.34), their theme and a **short title** per control, plus the numbers of
  sub-clauses 4.1 to 10.2 with a short title written by this project.
- **What it does not contain**: the control text, the ISO/IEC 27002 implementation guidance, or
  the text of the requirements (clauses 4 to 10). Justification and implementation fields are
  written by your organisation.
- **The standard must be purchased** from [ISO](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) or your
  national standards body (e.g. [AFNOR](https://www.boutique.afnor.org/)): the official text of
  ISO/IEC 27001 (requirements) and ideally ISO/IEC 27002 (implementation guidance) is required to
  implement an ISMS and seek certification.
- **The plugin does not grant any certification**: certification is issued by an accredited
  certification body. The plugin helps you prepare for the audit, nothing more.
