 * GLPI 11 and GLPI 12 from a single code base.
 *
 * GLPI 12 typed most properties of its base classes (CommonGLPI::$rightname becomes `string`,
 * CommonDBRelation::$itemtype_1 becomes `?string`...), while GLPI 11 leaves them untyped. PHP
 * requires a subclass to repeat EXACTLY the parent's type, so no single declaration works on both
 * versions (fatal error either way). Each affected class therefore extends an intermediate class
 * (Compatibility/Base/) declared according to the installed version: typed on 12, untyped on 11;
 * values come from the child class's own constants. A class rather than a trait: on PHP 8.2-8.4 a
 * trait cannot redeclare an inherited property with another value.
