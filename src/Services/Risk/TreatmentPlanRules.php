/**
 * Business rule behind `PluginGrcmanagerRiskTreatmentAction` (issue #31, ISO 27001 clause 8.3/6.1.3
 * "mise en œuvre effective du plan de traitement des risques"), extracted as pure PHP so it is
 * unit-testable without a running GLPI instance, same "logique pure-PHP testable sous
 * src/Services/" convention as GlpiPlugin\Grcmanager\Services\Capa\CapaRequirementService (the
 * closest existing template for "a decision that's plugin-internal to the entity gating a related
 * field's requirement level") and GlpiPlugin\Grcmanager\Services\Compliance\ComplianceObligationRules.
 *
 * A risk's treatment plan (its concrete treatment actions) is only relevant/required-ish for two of
 * the four `treatment` values (see PluginGrcmanagerRisk::getTreatments() via RiskAssessmentTrait):
 * `accept` has, by definition, no treatment to plan (the organization knowingly keeps the risk as
 * is), and `avoid` means eliminating the risk source entirely, nothing ongoing to track either.
 * Only `mitigate` and `transfer` describe a decision that still needs to be CARRIED OUT through
 * concrete actions over time, which is exactly what this issue adds tracking for.
 *
 * `overdue` is deliberately NOT one of the stored `status` values (self::ALLOWED_STATUSES):
 * every other "in retard"/"overdue" concept already in this plugin (CAPA due dates, review dates,
 * training renewals, policy reviews) is a DERIVED condition (due date passed AND not yet in a
 * terminal state), never a value an admin picks from a dropdown - see
 * GlpiPlugin\Grcmanager\Services\Capa\OverdueCapaService and TECH_DEBT.md Sprint 4. isOverdue()
 * below follows that exact same established convention rather than the three-status-plus-overdue
 * enum a first reading of the issue might suggest, see TECH_DEBT.md for this plugin's own note on
 * the deviation.
