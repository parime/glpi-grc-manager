/**
 * Finds risks whose review date has passed or is approaching, and raises GLPI's native
 * NotificationEvent for each one (see inc/notificationtargetrisk.class.php for the
 * NotificationTarget, and src/Install/Installer.php for the seeded Notification/
 * NotificationTemplate rows). Driven by the daily Cron task
 * PluginGrcmanagerRisk::cronReviewreminder() (see issue tracked in
 * docs/design/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, Sprint 2).
 *
 * Sprint 5 generalized this service to also drive PluginGrcmanagerSupplierRisk's own
 * cronReviewreminder(): both itemtypes share the exact same `status`/`review_date` columns and the
 * exact same "review due" semantics (see RiskAssessmentTrait), only the itemtype/table differ, so
 * a single `$itemtype` constructor argument was enough, no second copy of this query/notify logic.
 * GLPI's own Cron task model still requires one CronTask::Register() and one static
 * `cron<name>()` entry point per itemtype (see src/Install/Installer.php), and each itemtype needs
 * its own NotificationTarget class (GLPI dispatches NotificationEvent::raiseEvent() by the
 * notified item's own get_class()), so those two stay one-per-itemtype; only the query/notify
 * logic below is shared.
 *
 * Issue #30 (PluginGrcmanagerComplianceObligation) reuses this same service for a third itemtype
 * that has no `status` column at all (it has `compliance_status`, which grades compliance, not
 * whether the obligation is still being tracked) - the previously-hardcoded
 * `'status' => ['<>', 'closed']` exclusion is now the optional `$excludeCriteria` constructor
 * argument below, defaulting to that exact same criterion so PluginGrcmanagerRisk and
 * PluginGrcmanagerSupplierRisk see no behaviour change; PluginGrcmanagerComplianceObligation's own
 * cronReviewreminder() passes an empty array instead.
 *
 * NOTE: depends on GLPI's legacy global-namespace CommonDBTM classes (PluginGrcmanagerRisk and,
 * dynamically, PluginGrcmanagerSupplierRisk) and the NotificationEvent core class, not
 * unit-tested in isolation, same exclusion rationale as the sibling plugin
 * glpi-vulnerability-manager, see phpstan.neon.dist.
