/**
 * Pure "is this policy due for review" decision, extracted out of PolicyReviewReminderService so
 * it can be unit tested directly (tests/Unit/Services/Policy/PolicyReviewReminderWindowTest.php)
 * without a running GLPI instance, unlike the risk register's own
 * GlpiPlugin\Grcmanager\Services\Risk\ReviewReminderService, whose equivalent window check is
 * inlined into its `$prototype->find()` WHERE clause and documented as untestable in isolation
 * (see phpstan.neon.dist). A policy is flagged from REMINDER_WINDOW_DAYS before its
 * `next_review_date` and stays flagged for as long as it remains overdue, mirroring
 * ReviewReminderService::REMINDER_WINDOW_DAYS exactly (same 30-day lead time convention across
 * this plugin's review-reminder mechanisms).
 *
 * An `archived` policy is never due: it is a superseded version kept only for historical record
 * (ISO 27001 A.5.1.2 traceability), not a document anyone should still be reviewing - the
 * equivalent of the risk register's own `status <> 'closed'` exclusion.
