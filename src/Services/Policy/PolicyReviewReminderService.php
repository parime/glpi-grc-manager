/**
 * Finds security policies whose next review date has passed or is approaching, and raises GLPI's
 * native NotificationEvent for each one (see inc/notificationtargetpolicy.class.php for the
 * NotificationTarget, and src/Install/Installer.php for the seeded Notification/
 * NotificationTemplate rows). Driven by the daily Cron task
 * PluginGrcmanagerPolicy::cronReviewreminder() (issue #28, ISO/IEC 27001:2022
 * A.5.1/A.5.1.1/A.5.1.2).
 *
 * Mirrors GlpiPlugin\Grcmanager\Services\Risk\ReviewReminderService's overall structure (same
 * find()-then-raiseEvent()-per-row shape), but is its OWN class rather than a third caller of that
 * shared service: ReviewReminderService's query is hardcoded to `status <> 'closed'` and the
 * `review_date` column, which doesn't fit this itemtype's own `status`
 * (draft/approved/archived) / `next_review_date` columns (see PolicyLifecycle,
 * PolicyReviewReminderWindow). Fetches every non-archived policy with a `next_review_date` set,
 * broader than strictly necessary, then narrows to the actually-due ones with the pure, unit-tested
 * PolicyReviewReminderWindow::isDue() rather than re-deriving that window inline in SQL - the one
 * deliberate improvement over ReviewReminderService, which leaves its own equivalent window
 * untestable in isolation (see its docblock and phpstan.neon.dist).
 *
 * NOTE: depends on GLPI's legacy global-namespace CommonDBTM class (PluginGrcmanagerPolicy) and
 * the NotificationEvent core class, not unit-tested in isolation, same exclusion rationale as
 * ReviewReminderService, see phpstan.neon.dist.
