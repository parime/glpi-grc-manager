 * Business rule behind `PluginGrcmanagerObjectiveMeasurement` (issue #32, ISO 27001 clause 6.2):
 * extracted as pure PHP so it is unit-testable without a running GLPI instance, same
 * "logique pure-PHP testable sous src/Services/" convention as
 * GlpiPlugin\Grcmanager\Services\Capa\CapaRequirementService.
 *
 * An objective's target is not always a single number (see PluginGrcmanagerObjective's own
 * docblock: `target_value` is nullable, `target_description` carries a free-text qualitative
 * target alongside/instead of it). A measurement logged against a QUANTITATIVE objective
 * (`target_value` set) must itself carry a numeric value — otherwise there is nothing to plot on
 * the trajectory the objective exists to track. A measurement logged against a QUALITATIVE-ONLY
 * objective has no number to compare against, so its value stays optional, but the comment then
 * becomes the only record of progress and cannot be left empty (an empty comment AND no value
 * would be a measurement recording literally nothing).
