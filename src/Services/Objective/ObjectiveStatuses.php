/**
 * Pure enum/decision logic behind `PluginGrcmanagerObjective::status` (issue #32, ISO 27001 clause
 * 6.2), kept GLPI-independent (no $DB, no CommonDBTM, no __()) so it is unit-testable, same split
 * already used for the C/I/D classification register (ClassificationLevels): pure decision logic
 * here, thin $DB/HTML wrapper (labels/badges via __()) on the CommonDBTM class itself
 * (inc/objective.class.php).
 *
 * Five values rather than the risk register's four (identified/in_treatment/accepted/closed):
 * `not_started` (no measurement logged yet) is distinct from `on_track`/`at_risk` (in progress,
 * trajectory known), and `achieved`/`missed` are two different terminal outcomes an objective can
 * reach by its target_date, not a single generic "closed".
